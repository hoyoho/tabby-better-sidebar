 * `icon` goes through `sanitiseIcon()`, not `asString()`: Tabby renders an
 * icon starting with `<` through `innerHTML` (see `iconSanitize.ts`), and a
 * pasted JSON is exactly the untrusted input that check exists for — a plain
 * type check let an `<img onerror=…>` through unchanged. A profile whose
 * `type` has no entry in `PROFILE_OPTION_WHITELISTS` — an unrecognised
 * provider, or `local` — is dropped whole rather than partly sanitised: see
 * that constant for why a `local` profile in particular has no safe subset of
 * itself left to keep.
