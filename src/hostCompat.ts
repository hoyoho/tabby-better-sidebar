/**
 * What this plugin needs from its host, named one by one.
 *
 * The plugin reaches into Tabby well past its public API — it subclasses
 * `SFTPPanelComponent`, narrows tabs with `instanceof SSHTabComponent`, and
 * opens `EditProfileModalComponent` (which the typings do not export). None of
 * that is contractual, and a Tabby update can take any of it away.
 *
 * The point of this file is *not* to make the plugin survive that — it cannot.
 * It is to make the failure **say something**. Every one of these couplings
 * fails as a non-event today: a panel that stays empty, an `instanceof` that is
 * quietly false forever. Nothing is thrown, nothing reaches the console, and
 * the diagnosis starts from zero every time.
 *
 * Two deliberate non-goals:
 *
 * - **Not a Tabby version check.** A version number would cry wolf on a
 *   perfectly compatible release and stay silent on a fork or a local build
 *   that moved something. What is verified is the contact points themselves.
 * - **Not an all-or-nothing gate.** Each precondition names the feature it
 *   carries, so a missing `SFTPPanelComponent` costs the SFTP view and nothing
 *   else. The sidebar itself is now contributed through Tabby's public
 *   `SidebarContribution` API, so nothing here is fatal any more.
